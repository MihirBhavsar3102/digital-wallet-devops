# digital-wallet-devops

A DevOps assignment: take a ready-made NestJS + React + PostgreSQL wallet app and run it on AWS
with Terraform, a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, and CloudWatch monitoring.

> **Status: work in progress.** Only the repository setup is done so far. The infrastructure,
> pipeline, monitoring and the rest of this README are not written yet.

## Repo layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/` | The sample application (imported unmodified, then changed in later commits) |
| `infra/bootstrap/` | One-off Terraform that creates the remote-state bucket |
| `infra/modules/` | Reusable Terraform modules |
| `infra/envs/staging/`, `infra/envs/prod/` | One folder per environment, both calling the same modules |
| `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions pipelines |
| `scripts/` | Deploy and smoke-test scripts |
| `monitoring/` | CloudWatch agent configuration |
| `docs/` | Challenges log and approach documentation |

## Credits

The application in `app/` is [tedrosdev/digital-wallet](https://github.com/tedrosdev/digital-wallet),
imported at upstream commit `011bd00b2e43aee3c9f955b4bd84b73ac40338b7` (2024-12-23). The first commit
in this repository is that import, with file contents unchanged, so every later commit shows what
was changed on top of it. Its original README is kept at `app/UPSTREAM_README.md`.

Licence note: the upstream README says the project is MIT-licensed and links to a `LICENSE` file, but
no `LICENSE` file exists in the upstream repository, and its `backend/package.json` declares
`"license": "UNLICENSED"`. No licence text has therefore been copied here.
